## Meetings

We host a community meeting every 2nd and 4th Tuesdays of a month. 

You can add [this calendar](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MDQ0YmRydTllMXYzdWFoMmpsbjdqNXJlYmNfMjAyMDEwMjdUMDkwMDAwWiBzYWptb2hhbUByZWRoYXQuY29t&tmsrc=sajmoham%40redhat.com&scp=ALL) to get notification on Gluster Community.

Schedule -
Every 2nd and 4th Tuesday at 2:30 PM IST
Bridge: https://meet.google.com/cpu-eiue-hvk

Minutes of all previous meetings would be found [here](./meetings/)

##Steps to host community meeting:

Create a new hackmd page copying contents from [this template](./template.md).

Edit the values such as date, CFP update, flash talk, metrics, and other such things in the template

Send out a invite to gluster-devel and gluster-users list by mentioning the following:

        Bridge: https://meet.google.com/cpu-eiue-hvk

        Minutes meeting: {link to the new hackmd created by copying the template}

        Previous Meeting notes: https://github.com/gluster/community/meetings

When the meeting starts, we need to update the hackmd with the minutes. Suggested get someone for doing this atleast once the meeting starts.

Go through the items in the template one after the another.

We have to decide the host for the next meeting.

#Don't forget to push the meeting minutes
Once that is done, the minutes of the meeting have to be created as a {date}-Community-meeting.md file inside the meeting directory of the gluster/community project and pushed across to the repo.
Once pushed to the repo, the minutes of the meeting have to be sent to the gluster-users and gluster-devel. (make sure the content is copy pasted rather than providing a link)
