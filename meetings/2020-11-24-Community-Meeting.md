  - Host has to send the meeting minutes as a mail to the gluster-devel and gluster-users list.


### Notetaker

* Who will take notes from the next meeting?


### RoundTable

* [Pranith] -  Can we focus more on milliseconds / seconds optimizations instead of nanosecond improvements?
  - The focus should be more on latency in network layer, system calls, Locks etc.
  - It is not bad, but is it worth the effort?
  - For introduction into glusterfs, best things that have impact are cleanups in fini().

* [Amar] -  Review request on Simple-Quota patches [PR #1750](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/pull/1750) and [PR #1763](https://github.com/gluster/glusterfs/pull/1763)
